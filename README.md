#### Dapr and Service Meshes - Better Together | Diagrid

Kubernetes is a great platform for distributed applications. The challenges that come with portability and flexibility can be solved by using both Service Meshes and Dapr to make your architecture robust, resilient, and secure. In some cases, where you require capabilities that are unique to both, you will find it useful to leverage both Dapr alongside a Service Mesh, or you might find that the security, observability and resiliency features of Dapr alone are enough.

#### Enrich your location data with Azure Maps | Microsoft

Location information can be very simple or very detailed. For a person delivering a package to certain house, an address with street number, name, city, and state could be more than enough information for them to find the right place. For a vehicle tracking system where you have a map with moving dots representing trucks in real-time, these pieces of data may not be enough to provide clear information to a dispatcher. Adding the latitude and longitude of the vehicle to present its current and historical positions is more important.

#### Best practices: Securing your Amazon Location Service resources | Amazon Web Services

Location data is subjected to heavy scrutiny by security experts. Knowing the current position of a person, vehicle, or asset can provide industries with many benefits, whether to understand where a current delivery is, how many people are inside a venue, or to optimize routing for a fleet of vehicles. This blog post explains how Amazon Web Services (AWS) helps keep location data secured in transit and at rest, and how you can leverage additional security features to help keep information safe and compliant.
